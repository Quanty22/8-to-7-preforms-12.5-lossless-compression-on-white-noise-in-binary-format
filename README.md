12.5% lossless-compression-on-white noise in binary format
Discover the outcome of our prototype data compressor, capable of achieving lossless compression on white noise in binary format, 
currently achieving up to 12.5% compression ratio. 
Examine the initial file: "data_file.bin," and observe the compressed result in "dataFile.nvl.npz" after applying our 8(to)7compressor.
