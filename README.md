12.5% lossless-compression-on-white noise in binary format Discover the outcome of our 8(to)7 prototype data compressor, 
capable of achieving lossless compression on white noise in binary format, 
currently achieving up to 12.5% in 7 bit system coding compression ratio. 
Examine the initial files: "3000data.bin,and data_04194304_mod.bin" and observe the compressed result in "3000inpack.npz.nvl" after applying our 8(to)7compressor. 
The transition from 8(to)7 is revolutionizing the landscape of data as we currently perceive it. 
We understand that there will be questions on our algorithms and codes, particularly on the methods we employed to achieve this compressor. 
Our existing quantum-resistant encryption (you can already find the open-source code here) 
combined with our compressor forms a formidable combination.
